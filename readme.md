# Predicting Natural Disaster Tweets Using Binary Classification
This is a group project for a machine learning class at San Diego State.
We are basing our project on the Kaggle competition [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview)

These notebooks may be run on [jupyterhub.sdsu.edu](https://jupyterhub.sdsu.edu) with the PyTorch notebook and 1 GPU.

## Install Additional Packages
Assuming that you are running this from the PyTorch notebook:

From the root of the repo, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Getting the Raw Data (Optional)
Follow these steps to get the raw data (assumes running linux, macOS or Windows Subsytem for linux):

1. Log into or create your Kaggle account
2. Accept the competition at the link above
3. Install kaggle CLI:
    ```bash
    pip install kaggle
    ```
4. Sign in and download your kaggle.json from [settings](https://www.kaggle.com/settings) > API > Create new token
5. Configure kaggle CLI with kaggle.json:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
    mv ~/Downloads/kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
    chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
    ```
6. Run the [get_data.sh](./getting-started/get_data.sh) script or use the [data_exploration](./getting-started/data_exploration.ipynb) notebook

### Processed Datasets
We have included all of our processed datasets for convenience.
Alternatively, you could download the raw data from Kaggle and then step through the datasets notebooks, starting with the [data_cleaner](./datasets/data_cleaner.ipynb) notebook.

## Running the Models
All of our individual models are available in the base-models directory.
These models are logically named after the type of machine learning model that they defined, trained and evaluated.
- Note: the BERT Finetuned model was too large to check into git and may be submitted separately for this assignment as "finetuned_bert_model.tar.gz". Otherwise, run the [finetuned_bert](./base-models/finetuned_bert.ipynb) notebook to produce the model.
- Note: The BERT Finetuned model should be placed at the path `base-models/finetuned_bert/` and extracted with the command `tar -xzvf finetuned_bert_model.tar.gz`, the filename should be `model.safetensors`

### Final Model
Our best and final model, which we submitted to Kaggle for the competition, is the [Modular Ensemble](./stacking-models/modular_ensemble.ipynb).
- Note: All other models should be saved to .pkl file before running this notebook.
- Note: The BERT Finetuned model should be placed at the path `base-models/finetuned_bert/` and extracted with the command `tar -xzvf finetuned_bert_model.tar.gz`, the filename should be `model.safetensors`

## Evaluation
Each of our models' respective notebook contains evaluation code to check its accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores which are then saved to the [scores](./evaluation/scores.csv) file used in the evaluation notebook.
In addition to inline evaluation, we generated charts for comparison in the [evaluation](./evaluation/evaluation.ipynb) notebook.

## Prediction
You may load up and run our model against arbitrary text using the [prediction](./prediction/prediction.ipynb) notebook.
- Note: All other models should be saved to .pkl file before running this notebook.
- Note: The BERT Finetuned model should be placed at the path `base-models/finetuned_bert/` and extracted with the command `tar -xzvf finetuned_bert_model.tar.gz`, the filename should be `model.safetensors`

## Results
Our best model, the modular ensemble, gained a competition score of 0.83849 placing us at position 76 on the leaderboard at the time of writing.
